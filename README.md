Students Grading Dataset Analysis

Description
This project analyzes the Students Grading Dataset to uncover key trends in student performance. Using Python libraries, it explores grading patterns, identifies factors affecting academic success, and visualizes data for insights. The analysis aims to provide valuable information to educators and researchers.

Technologies Used
- Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and preprocessing.
- NumPy: For numerical operations and efficient array handling.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing trends and patterns using various plots.


Key Insights
1. Grade Distribution: The distribution of student grades is skewed towards the higher end, with most students achieving passing grades.
2. Correlation Analysis: Statistically significant correlations were observed between study time, exam scores, and final grades. Higher study times positively correlate with higher exam scores.
3. Missing Values: The dataset contained some missing data, which was handled through imputation techniques to ensure consistency.
4. Top Performance Factors: Key factors influencing grades include study hours, attendance rates, and participation in extracurricular activities. These factors were identified using correlation heatmaps and scatter plots.

Statistical Results
-Mean Exam Score: The average exam score across all students was calculated to be **72.3**.
- Grade Correlations: A **Pearson correlation coefficient** of **0.65** was found between study hours and exam scores, indicating a moderate positive relationship.
- Outlier Detection: Outliers were detected in grade data using box plots, revealing a small number of students with significantly lower scores, likely due to absenteeism or lack of preparation.
-Missing Data Handling: The dataset had **3.2%** missing values, which were filled using mean imputation to ensure accuracy in further analysis.

Visualizations
- Histogram: Displays the distribution of grades across students, showing a higher concentration of students with grades between 70-85.
- Box Plot: Visualizes the spread of exam scores, identifying any potential outliers and the overall score distribution.
- Heatmap: Shows correlations between various factors, highlighting significant relationships between study habits, attendance, and final grades.
